Proposed in ["Editing Models with Task Arithmetic"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04089), task arithmetic is a new paradigm for adapting neural networks to new tasks.

This paradigm is based on task vectors, defined as a direction in the weight
space of a pre-trained model towards a space region in which results on a
task are improved.
Such vectors, once obtained, can be added or subtracted, leading to different results.
